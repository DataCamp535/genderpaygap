# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. No issues should be faced running the code using Python version 3.*.

# Project Motivation
To analyze whether there exists a gender pay gap among male and female developers in Germany, Stack Overflow survey data from 2022 was used. First, differences in the background of all participants were analyzed:

1. Gender distribution
2. Educational degree of male and female participants
3. Working experience of male and female participants
4. Professional coding experience of male and female participants
5. Overall coding experience of male and female participants
6. Age of male and female participants
7. Organizational size of the companies male and female participants work for

After determining the differences in both groups' background, salaries of both groups were compared. To determine whether there exists a gender pay gap not caused by the differences in background, a statistical test was performed.

# Results
The main findings of the analysis can be found in the blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@data.camp535/gender-pay-gap-among-developers-in-germany-d4987374bb1a).
